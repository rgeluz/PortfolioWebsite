--Readme document for Roman Geluz--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

10/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 2/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 2/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
	There are several pages for this website.
	I have included several images to the website. There are images for the home page, about page, courses page, school projects page, and personal projects page. Every image has a descriptive alt attribute. See below for references/urls for the images.
	Every page has appropriate Headings. For some pages with content that is not complete, I have added dummy text, which is generated "Lorem Ipsum" text from https://www.lipsum.com/
	Every Page has a navigation bar (Using Bootstrap 4) at the top that allows navigation between pages.
	The website does use HTML5 semantic tags such as <nav>, <section> and <footer>.
	The website utilizes custom icons, specifically from Fontawesome.com
		"<script src="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.11.1/js/all.js"></script>"
	The website has many buttons that link to external websites, as well as to other pages within the website.

(b) CSS features
	
	The website makes use of padding and margins throughout different pages.
	The custom css file "style.css" utilizes padding and margin attributes in several of it's selectors.
	The website uses the Bootstrap 4.0 library and many html tags use bootstrap classes.
	The website is responsive and utilizes Media Queries.
	The website's buttons have visual behavior when hovered over or clicked on.
	In the custom css file "style.css", many images, buttons, and icons are resized using the different attributes.
	The css file utilizes the font family "Poppins"
		and makes a call to //@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:400,500,700');


(c) Advanced features
	There are several advance features incorporated into the website.
	The website makes uses of many of Bootstrap 4.0 features:
		Collapsable Navigation Bar
		Carousel with three pages and carousel indicators to select between the pages.
		Jumbotron.
		Cards that use the grid-system, such as "col-md-4" bootstrap class and when the window is resized to a smaller window width, the cards are stacked providing website responsiveness.
	
	The site has a custom floating button that when clicked, scrolls the webpage to the top of the page.
	The site has an embedded pdf displayer, to display my resume, as well as serveral buttons that display the resume on a different web browser tab.
	The site uses javascript (located in the head tag of each webpage), to provide "Jump to the top of the Page" behavior, when the green up arrow, button at the bottom of the page, is clicked.	
		


3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
	The website itself took me about two full days to complete. However, in preparation to building the website, I had spent two days watching online tutorials to learn how to build a website from scratch. I used Youtube to learn how to implement certain features. I also used stack overflow and other sites for questions on minor implementations. Prior to writing the first line of code, I created a MockUp using powerpoint to be use as a guide/outline of the website.
	The validation took a really long time to resolve. A lot of the examples I used did not pass validation.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
	I did not consult with anyone else, other than online resources. The website was built entirely by me, with the guidance of developer expert youtubers.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
	No, it works on Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox web browsers. I have not tested the website on other browsers.
